Thank you for your interest in the Social Likes!

This project is powered by you, the user, which means I, the author, can’t answer support questions, fix non-critical bugs and implement feature requests.

But I can:

- review your pull request,
- publish a new release,
- give you push access if you want to maintain the project.

Consider using the Social Likes Next instead: http://social-likes-next.js.org/
